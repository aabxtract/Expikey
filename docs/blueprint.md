# **App Name**: EmotiKey

## Core Features:

- Emotion Capture & Token Preview: Capture user's emotion through input field or preset options and generate a unique token preview with color, pattern, and mood signature hash, offering a live animated preview of the emotional token.
- Token Minting: Enable users to mint the generated emotional token as an NFT (EmotiKey) after connecting their wallet, displaying the token animation and metadata clearly.
- Emotional Gallery: Showcase all minted emotional tokens in a grid, displaying the animated token, emotion label, date, color swatch, and minter's address with soft hover animations.
- Emotional Streak Tracker: Track and display the user's emotion submission streak, showing the current streak, longest streak, and missing days with a simple and intuitive UI.
- Community Emotion Map: Visualize global emotional trends on a real-time bubble map. Bubble color represents the dominant emotion color, and size indicates the number of people who minted that emotion today. This serves as a global emotional heatmap. The size and color of the emotion are influenced by AI and selected accordingly.
- Deterministic Color Generation: Derive color palettes deterministically based on emotion string inputs to bring predictability. The 'tool' generates hash values of the emotion, and map them to HSL/HSV color palettes.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft purple (#A094BC) for spiritual and artistic vibes, inspired by tranquility and creativity.
- Background color: Light grayish purple (#E6E5E8), a desaturated pastel variant of the primary color, is intended to provide a gentle backdrop that highlights the interface's active elements while keeping the focus on the visuals.
- Accent color: Muted blue (#7398A3), an analogous hue that provides a subtle contrast and works well for interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Belleza', a humanist sans-serif. Longer texts should use 'Alegreya'.
- Implement blurred glass panels to provide depth and a frosted appearance.
- Incorporate animated fluid shapes that subtly shift to enhance the representation of feelings.
- Employ gentle hover and pulse effects for a soft, responsive UI.
